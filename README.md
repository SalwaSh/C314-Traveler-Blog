# TravelerBlog 📷✨

## Overview 🌐
The task is to create a website for a Traveler that showcases their work and provides 
information about their services. The website will have five pages: a home page, an 
about me page, a contact page, a blog, and a gallery page. The gallery page will 
feature three categories of the traveler’s work: food pictures, landmark pictures, and 
celebrations pictures. 

To complete the activity, we will use Django, Python, and Bootstrap. The tasks will 
involve creating web pages, forms, as well as connecting to a MySQL database to store 
and retrieve data for display. The project will provide valuable experience in building 
web applications using these technologies and demonstrate the ability to create a 
functional and visually appealing website for a client.
